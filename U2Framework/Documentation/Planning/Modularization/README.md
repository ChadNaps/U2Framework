# Outline

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Directory Structure
- Create a directory structure that categorizes fragments by domain and topic. For example:
  ```
  /templates
    /science
      /intro.md
      /methodology.md
    /technology
      /intro.md
      /frameworks.md
  ```

### 2. Fragment Creation
- Start breaking down existing documents into smaller fragments and save them in the appropriate directories.

### 3. GitHub Actions Setup
- Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `assemble.yml`) that specifies how to assemble the fragments into complete documents.
  
  ```yaml
  name: Assemble Documents
  on:
    push:
      paths:
        - 'templates/**'
  jobs:
    build:
      runs-on: ubuntu-latest
      steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Assemble Fragments
        run: ./assemble.sh  # This script should handle the assembly logic
  ```

### 4. Assembly Script
- Write a script (e.g., `assemble.sh`) that the GitHub Actions workflow will execute. This script will concatenate the fragments in the correct order to produce the final documents.

### 5. Contribution Guidelines
- Update the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file to include guidelines on how to contribute to the fragmented templates.

### 6. Peer Review Setup
- Configure GitHub's pull request and review features to ensure that all contributions go through a vetting process.

### 7. Test Run
- Perform a test run by making a change to a fragment and observing the GitHub Actions workflow. Ensure that the final document is assembled correctly.

### 8. Documentation
- Update the `README.md` to explain the fragmented templating system and how to navigate it.

### 9. Iterative Refinement
- As the system is used, continuously refine the process based on feedback and the evolving needs of the project.
